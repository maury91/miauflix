As in the previous series, Sir Alan Sugar continued as the boss, assigning the teams specifically designed tasks. Nick Hewer and Margaret Mountford also returned as Sugar's advisers and observed the teams in action. In addition, a companion discussion program called The Apprentice: You're Fired! was introduced and aired on BBC Three.\n\nThis series premiered in Australia on 27 August 2008 at 9:30pm on Channel Seven, under the title Sir Alan Sugar: The Apprentice to distinguish it from the US version. Despite heavy promotion of the series during Seven's Olympic coverage, the series only rated 583,000 viewers nationally, which was third for its timeslot. The following week, the series was moved to 10:30pm, and ratings have continued to decrease. The series also airs in Australia on pay TV channel UKTV.",

Moving from BBC Two, this series attracted 10,000 applicants and promised \"tougher tasks and better people\" than before, however Sir Alan believed that the show was morphing into \"Big Brother\". Sugar also criticised the US version for making the error of \"trying to change things just for the sake of it\", causing it to backfire.\n\nTwo 90-minute specials were aired during the series run. The first programme was titled The Apprentice: Beyond the Boardroom and featured information about the personal lives of each of the semi-finalists. The second, The Apprentice: Why I Fired Them, featured Sugar revealing why he chose to remove each candidate from the programme.",
