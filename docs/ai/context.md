## üìä Current Implementation Status (Updated 2025-06-23)

### ‚úÖ **Backend: 95% Complete and Production-Ready**

**DO NOT rebuild these systems - they are already complete:**

- **Authentication**: Full JWT system with refresh tokens (AuthService: 228 lines, 18 methods)
- **Source Discovery**: Multi-provider content aggregation (YTS + THERARBG) with background processing
- **Media Streaming Infrastructure**: Complete client with peer-to-peer networking (DownloadService: 179 lines)
- **Database Layer**: 13 entities with AES-256-GCM encryption, complete repository pattern
- **Background Tasks**: 7 scheduled tasks running continuously (0.1s - 5s intervals)
- **API Infrastructure**: All routes except streaming endpoint implemented
- **Episode Sync Management**: Smart episode syncing with GREEDY/ON_DEMAND modes and watching flags

### ‚ùå **Only 2 Things Missing (Critical Blockers)**

1. **Stream Endpoint**: `/api/stream/:sourceId` - prevents video playback
2. **Frontend JWT Integration**: Token management and authentication flow

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Frontend Status**

- **Framework**: React + Redux Toolkit + Vite (well-structured)
- **Issue**: Currently has TypeScript errors and build problems
- **Missing**: JWT authentication integration with backend

## üéØ **What This Means for Development**

### **DO THIS** ‚úÖ

- Focus on the 2 missing components above
- Fix frontend TypeScript/build issues
- Connect frontend to existing backend auth
- Implement the stream endpoint

### **DON'T DO THIS** ‚ùå

- Rebuild authentication (it's complete)
- Rebuild source aggregation (it's complete)
- Rebuild WebTorrent infrastructure (it's complete)
- Create new database entities (13 already exist)
- Rebuild background processing (7 tasks already running)

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Quick Facts**

- **Backend**: Node.js + Hono framework + SQLite + TypeORM
- **Frontend**: React + Redux Toolkit + Vite
- **Deployment**: Docker + docker-compose + nginx
- **Media Streaming**: WebTorrent library for peer-to-peer delivery
- **Auth**: JWT tokens with JOSE library
- **Database**: SQLite with field-level encryption

## üìà **Project Timeline Reality**

- **Previous estimates**: "Months of infrastructure work needed"
- **Actual status**: 2-3 weeks to full functionality
- **Key insight**: Documentation was severely outdated vs implementation

## üîç **Key Service Files (All Complete)**

```typescript
// These are production-ready, don't rebuild:
backend / src / services / auth / auth.service.ts; // 228 lines, 18 methods
backend / src / services / source / source.service.ts; // 719 lines, 24 methods
backend / src / services / download / download.service.ts; // 179 lines
backend / src / services / media / media.service.ts; // TMDB + Trakt integration + episode sync
```

## üé¨ **Episode Sync Management (New Feature)**

### **Configuration**

- **Environment Variable**: `EPISODE_SYNC_MODE`
- **Values**: `GREEDY` (sync all episodes) or `ON_DEMAND` (sync only watched shows)
- **Default**: `ON_DEMAND`

### **How It Works**

1. **GREEDY Mode**: Background task syncs all incomplete seasons (original behavior)
2. **ON_DEMAND Mode**:
   - Shows are marked as "watching" when user accesses them
   - Background task only syncs episodes for shows where `watching: true`
   - Efficient tracking without heavy progress queries

### **Database Changes**

- **TVShow Entity**: Added `watching: boolean` field (default: false)
- **TVShowRepository**: Methods to manage watching status
- **MediaService**: Automatically marks shows as watching on access

### **Usage**

```bash
# Set sync mode
export EPISODE_SYNC_MODE=ON_DEMAND  # Default behavior
export EPISODE_SYNC_MODE=GREEDY     # Sync all episodes

# Background task automatically adapts to mode
```

## üß™ **Testing Infrastructure**

- **E2E Tests**: Docker-based with mock services
- **Unit Tests**: Jest with comprehensive mocks
- **HTTP Fixtures**: Pre-recorded API responses (don't make real API calls in tests)
- **Commands**: `npm test --workspace backend`, `npm run test:backend:e2e`

## üö® **Critical Context for AI Assistants**

1. **Previous Documentation Was Wrong**: Massive 95%+ implementation was documented as "incomplete"
2. **Focus is Key**: Only 2 missing pieces, don't get distracted by "todo" lists
3. **Background Tasks Active**: 7 tasks running every 0.1-5 seconds, system is live
4. **Frontend Needs Attention**: Has build issues but good architecture
5. **Stream Endpoint is Blocker**: This single endpoint prevents video playback

---

**Bottom Line**: This is a nearly-complete, sophisticated streaming platform that needs 2 specific features, not a ground-up rebuild.
