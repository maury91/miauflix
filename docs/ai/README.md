# ü§ñ AI Assistant Documentation

> **Purpose**: Documentation specifically designed for AI assistants working on the Miauflix project.

## üìÅ What's in this directory

| File                                 | Purpose                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`context.md`](context.md)           | **START HERE** - Project background, current status, and key facts   |
| [`patterns.md`](patterns.md)         | Code patterns, conventions, and architectural decisions              |
| [`workflows.md`](workflows.md)       | Common development tasks and their step-by-step implementations      |
| [`gotchas.md`](gotchas.md)           | Important warnings, constraints, and things to avoid                 |
| [`file-mapping.md`](file-mapping.md) | Quick reference: what files to modify for different types of changes |

## üéØ How to use this documentation

1. **Always read [`context.md`](context.md) first** - it contains critical project status info
2. **Check [`gotchas.md`](gotchas.md)** before making any changes - avoid known pitfalls
3. **Use [`file-mapping.md`](file-mapping.md)** to quickly find where to make changes
4. **Follow [`patterns.md`](patterns.md)** for code style and architectural consistency
5. **Reference [`workflows.md`](workflows.md)** for step-by-step task guidance

## ‚ö° Quick Start for AI Assistants

```markdown
# Before working on Miauflix:

1. Read docs/ai/context.md (current project status)
2. Check docs/ai/gotchas.md (things that will break)
3. Use docs/ai/file-mapping.md (where to make changes)
4. Follow docs/ai/patterns.md (how to write code)
```

## üîÑ Keeping this updated

This documentation should be updated when:

- Project status changes significantly
- New patterns emerge
- Critical gotchas are discovered
- File organization changes

---

_This directory exists because human-focused documentation often lacks the specific context and warnings that AI assistants need to work effectively on a codebase._
