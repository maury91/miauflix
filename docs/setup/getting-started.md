# Getting Started with Miauflix

> **Quick Start**: Just want to try it? Run these commands and you're done in 5 minutes!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maury91/miauflix.git && cd miauflix
docker compose run --rm backend npm run config-only
docker compose up -d
```

The first command clones the repository, the second runs the configuration wizard, and the third starts the full stack. No local Node.js installation needed!

## Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for cloning the repository)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for local development only)
- [TMDB API Access Token](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) (required for media content)
- [Trakt.tv API Client ID](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications) (optional, for list synchronization)
- VPN subscription (optional)

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended)

#### 1. Clone and Configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maury91/miauflix.git
cd miauflix

# Interactive configuration wizard
docker compose run --rm backend npm run config-only
```

This will run the configuration wizard, which will ask you for the required environment variables, and guide you on how to obtain them.

#### 2. [Optional] Set up VPN

If you want to use VPN integration, add your NordVPN private key to `.env`:

```bash
# Follow the guide at: https://github.com/bubuntux/nordlynx/pkgs/container/nordlynx#how-to-get-your-private_key
NORDVPN_PRIVATE_KEY=your-nordvpn-private-key
```

A couple of notes about VPN:

Miauflix currently detects only NordVPN and will automatically disable some features when a VPN is not detected. You can override this behavior by setting `DISABLE_VPN_CHECK=true` in `.env`. This is recommended only if you're willing to accept the privacy risks of not using a VPN, or if you're using a VPN and are certain it's always active (for example, through a Docker service or Pi-hole).

#### 3. [Optional] Set up HTTPS and domain name

If you want to use HTTPS, you can set up an SSL certificate.

```bash
chmod +x setup-ssl.sh
./setup-ssl.sh -d yourdomain.com
```

This will generate an SSL certificate and key, and configure Nginx accordingly.

More details on how to set up HTTPS can be found in the [SSL Certificates](ssl-certificates.md) guide.

#### 4. Start Services

```bash
# Option 1: Start all services
docker compose up -d

# Option 2: Start backend only in production mode
npm run start:backend:docker:prod
```

The first option starts all services (backend, nginx, VPN, etc.) in the background. The second option starts only the backend service in production mode with automatic building.

#### 5. Access Application

- Frontend: `https://yourdomain.com/`
- API Health: `https://yourdomain.com/health`

### Option 2: Local Development

#### Frontend Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start with hot reload (recommended for development)
npm run start:frontend
```

The development server provides instant hot reload and fast feedback for UI work.

#### SSR Testing

```bash
# Test with Server-Side Rendering
npm run dev:frontend:ssr
```

Use this only when testing SSR-specific functionality or debugging SSR issues.

#### Backend Development

```bash
# Interactive configuration and start
npm run start:backend

# Development with mock data
npm run start:backend:e2e
```

## Configuration System

Miauflix includes an intelligent configuration wizard that:

- ‚úÖ Automatically detects missing environment variables
- üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Guides you through an interactive setup process
- üîÑ Tests API credentials in real-time as you enter them
- üìù Provides helpful guidance on obtaining required tokens
- üíæ Saves all settings to a `.env` file when completed

### Manual Configuration

If running in a non-interactive environment, create a `.env` file with the required variables.

For a complete reference of all available environment variables, see the [Environment Variables Guide](environment-variables.md).

## Initial User

Miauflix creates an initial user with random credentials on first run.

Credentials are stored encrypted in the database, so you won't find them there. They are printed to the logs during the first startup. Retrieve them and then redact/remove the logs:

```bash
# Example: show recent backend logs (adjust service name if different)
docker compose logs backend --since=15m
```

Important: rotate the initial password after first login and avoid storing credentials in logs or tickets.
